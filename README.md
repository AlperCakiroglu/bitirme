# bitirme
This is a project about artificial intelligence.There is a simulation.There are a robot,obstacles and target object in this simulation.
Robot is controlled by computer.Robot's aim is reaching the target object.For this, I am creating motion graph with PRM and My Algorithm.
Then,I find the shortest path with Dijkstra's Algorithm. Then I create the world with Box2D and show the simulation with SFML. Libraries
and the code(cpp) files are in "bitirme" folder.
